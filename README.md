# Cocktail-finder
My first project based on SPA architecture, with Node.js web-server and Mongo database, just to understand how it works.

Used technologies and libraries:
client side:
  - jQuery
  - jQuery UI
  - Font Awesome
  - Lodash

server side (written on Node.js):
  - Express.js
  - Passport.js
  - Mongoose.js
  
database: mongoDB
